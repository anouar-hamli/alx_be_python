# Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## Project Overview

This project dives deeper into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It explores advanced concepts like constructors, destructors, magic methods, inheritance, composition, polymorphism, and more.

## Project Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

1. **Understand Key OOP Concepts**:

   * Describe the functionalities of constructors (`__init__`), destructors (`__del__`), and common magic methods (e.g., `__str__`, `__repr__`) in Python classes.

2. **Master Inheritance**:

   * Implement inheritance to create new classes that inherit properties and methods from existing classes.
   * Explain the concepts of single, multiple, and multilevel inheritance in Python.
   * Understand the Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Python and how it affects method calls in inheritance hierarchies.

3. **Utilize Composition**:

   * Use composition as an alternative to inheritance for building complex objects.

4. **Leverage Polymorphism**:

   * Implement polymorphism and method overriding to create flexible and reusable code.
   * Explain and use Pythonâ€™s duck typing to achieve polymorphic behavior.

5. **Distinguish Class Methods from Static Methods**:

   * Understand the differences between class methods and static methods based on their usage and purpose.
   * Apply `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` decorators appropriately in your Python classes.

## Features

* Hands-on examples for each concept to solidify your understanding.
* Comparisons between inheritance and composition to guide your architectural decisions.
* Real-world examples of polymorphism and duck typing to illustrate their flexibility.
* Insights into using magic methods to enhance Python classes.

## Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of Python programming.
* Familiarity with basic OOP concepts like classes and objects.

## Tools and Libraries

* Python 3.x
* Any text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook).
